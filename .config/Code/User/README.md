not sure if I will be using this

might need a profile for WSL, Mac, etc

but we can symlink stuff here to the local vs code location so we can have consistent keybinds, settings, extensions, etc

```
Windows: %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
Linux: ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json
```
